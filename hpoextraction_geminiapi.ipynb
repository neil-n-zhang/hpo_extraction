    "query=\"at the age of 22, 5 years this German woman experienced muscle cramps, progressive paresis and muscle wasting beginning in one leg and spreading to the other leg without sensory, autonomic or cognitive symptoms. A myopathy was initially suspected but EMG revealed acute and chronic signs of denervation mostly in the legs but also slightly in the upper limbs. Transcortical magnetic evoked potential (MEP) examination was pathological with delayed central conductance time to both lower limbs but not to the upper limbs. Peripheral nerve conduction studies were normal. The medical history was unremarkable except for a voluntarily weight loss of ≈10 kg in the years before appearance of muscle symptoms. Both the parents have diabetes mellitus type 2, but there is no family history of a neuromuscular disease (NMD) or FTD-like condition. The patient eventually received a diagnosis of sALS. The disease has developed slowly, symptoms and signs of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) damage only appearing in the upper limbs 3 years after onset in the lower limbs. Nine years after onset of paresis, the patient is alive and still show no bulbar symptoms.\"\n",
